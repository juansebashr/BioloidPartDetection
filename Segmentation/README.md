# Segmentation 

In parallel of the work of detection and tracking of the Bioloid parts, the work of the segmentation of the images began with a view to making a segmentation and complete monitoring of each part of the Bioloid while it is walking in the future.

For this we began using a U-net network implemented in the Notebook presented in this directory, and that is also available in Colab [![Open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13pYV2sm6NUWw8CrJsL9vPo6kfp_RZP-r/view?usp=sharing)
