This file includes functionality for combination of object poses with 
background images. It also allows for the object to be translated first.
During merging the brightness of the background can be adjusted to match
that of the object pose.

    """
    Function that adds a translation to the object pose, before merging
    with the background. An occlusion is also introduced by allowing part
    of the object to move outside of the image frame. This leads to only part
    of the object being visible in the final image. The amount of possible
    occlusion is controlled by the pad_ratio. A temporary frame is created
    that is larger on each side than the original image by 
    original_dim*pad_ratio. E.g. 300*300 pixel image with pad_ratio 0.1
    will create a 320*320 frame. The object is then moved to a random position
    within this frame. A final image is created by taking the original sized
    image, cutting out any part of the object being outside of this image. 

    Arguments:
        foreground_image (PIL image): An object pose to be translated
        pad_ratio (float): Additional padding around the original image.
                        Introduced for the purpose of occlusion. See above.
